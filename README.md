# Guise

This is a web-based creative space for designing how applications look and feel. Built with [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/), it provides a browser-like playground and a collection of [color tools](https://github.com/kayxean/color) to experiment with. More design environments are on the way.
